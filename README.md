## Questions

Please answer each of the following questions within the README.md file of your application repo (and be sure to commit it!). You only need a couple lines per answer, and point form answers are fine.

0. Which browser would you prefer we test this in?

This was developed using the latest version of Chrome.

0. How long did you work on this programming exercise for?

The exercise took about 2hs and 45min.

0. What websites did you use to help you complete this exercise? Please provide links.

[CSS Tricks] (http://css-tricks.com)

0. If you had more time, how would you improve your implementation?

These are some of the first steps I would consider

* Add animations/transitions and hover styles if it was specified in the requirements documentation.
* Use SCSS/Compass to manage the sprites, separate variables and use extends/mixings appropriately.

0. Anything else you'd like us to know?

I didn't use any JS framework or library since the exercise did not specify any content or behaviour expected for the application.
