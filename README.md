# Front-end Developer Exercise

We're constantly on the lookout for talented front-end developers to join our
team. Not only does that mean we're looking for a solid understanding of the
HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages, but also their practical application with
respect to how browsers work today.

## Setup

You'll need the following to complete this exercise:

* git installed
* a github account. If you don't have one already, please go to https://github.com/ and sign up for your free account.
* a working development environment, including code editor of choice, for HTML, CSS and JS development
* Photoshop or another way to view .psd files would be helpful, but is not necessary

## The contents of this project

* A three break-point responsive design for a game franchise navigation
* Sliced up images & a sprite sheet
* Web fonts
* 3 empty files for your HTML, CSS & JavaScript output

## The task

The goal of this exercise is for us to assess your approach to developing
the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the navigation and page structure design across
three break-points.

The key deliverables of this exercise are the following 3 files:

* [index.html](index.html)
* [main.css](main.css)
* [main.js](main.js)

Use discretion when using external libraries or tools to complete the
exercise. We are interested in your practical knowledge of HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, not your ability to use plugins, frameworks or libraries.

You will be using git for source control.

Following the completion of the application, you'll answer a few questions about the work you just completed.

Please allow approximately 2.5 hours for this exercise. It should take you about 2 hours to complete the programming exercise and another 30 min to answer the follow up questions.

When you are done the exercise, commit all your work in github and push it up to your github.com account. You'll be required to send us the link to your work immediately after completion.

## Questions

Please answer each of the following questions within the README.md file of your application repo (and be sure to commit it!). You only need a couple lines per answer, and point form answers are fine.

0. Which browser would you prefer we test this in?

0. How long did you work on this programming exercise for?

0. What websites did you use to help you complete this exercise? Please provide links.
